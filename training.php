            <h5>Course Overview : </h5>
            <p>The course covers the fundamental concepts of Apache Hadoop and it’s ecosystem. 
               It covers how to deploy, manage, monitor, and secure a Hadoop Cluster using Cloudera manager/HortonWorks 
               Sandbox and Ambari. It also covers backups, high availability, federation and possible disaster recovery 
               scenarios. In Hadoop’s echo system, we will cover basics about HBase, Pig, Flume, Hive, Impala, Sqoop 
               and Oozie. Guest lectures and practical labs including real life projects provide skills to succeed 
               in challenging work environment.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>Objectives : </h5>
            <p>Basics of Hadoop along with it’s Ecosystem. HDFS and MapReduce. Hadoop cluster – setup, maintenance, 
               monitoring, troubleshooting and recovery from failure. Load balancing, High availability &amp; Federation.
               Hardware and network requirements and optimal configurations. Kerberos-based security for Hadoop cluster.
               Ecosystem - HBase, Pig, Flume, Hive, Impala, Sqoop and Oozie.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>Lab Overview : </h5>
            <p>Each student set up a pseudo distributed single node cluster on their laptops. In addition, students 
               will be shown how to run a larger ~4 to 8 node cluster in Rackspace along with real life data projects. 
               The structure will consist of about 40% labs and 60% lecture. Hands-on exercises will be done throughout 
               the course.
