							<h5>Course Overview : </h5><p>Complete overview of Hadoop, it’s components and implementation details. This course will go into 
								more detail and be tailored more to the real world than other Hadoop course offered. The instruction 
								is led by seasoned software engineers who have experience developing real work Big Data projects.</p> 
								<br><h5>Objectives : </h5>
								<p>Goal is for the student to gain a thorough understanding of the Hadoop ecosystem, basic operational 
								considerations provide them with knowledge of how to develop applications using Hadoop with Java and 
								finally provide working knowledge of important advanced topics.</p> 
								<br><h5>Lab Overview : </h5>
								<p>The lab is a student tailored project that will bring together the various concepts learned during the course. 
								Together with the instructor the student will design a project that can use an existing or one their own 
								data sets. This project concept will be determined at the beginning of class, allowing the student to take 
								the concepts taught and apply them to a project tailored to their need/liking.</p> 
								<br><h5>Prerequisite &amp; Target Audience : </h5>
								<p>This course is designed for Developers, students and technical managers who want to learn to implement 
								Hadoop MapReduce jobs or manage Big data projects. The course is ideal for experienced software developers 
								who have experience in traditional data management technologies and want to upgrade their skills.</p> 
								<br><h5>Duration : </h5> <p>4-5 Days OR 32-40 Hours</p>

							<h5>Course Overview : </h5><p>The course covers the fundamental concepts of Apache Hadoop and it’s ecosystem. 
								It covers how to deploy, manage, monitor, and secure a Hadoop Cluster using Cloudera manager/HortonWorks 
								Sandbox and Ambari. It also covers backups, high availability, federation and possible disaster recovery 
								scenarios. In Hadoop’s echo system, we will cover basics about HBase, Pig, Flume, Hive, Impala, Sqoop 
								and Oozie. Guest lectures and practical labs including real life projects provide skills to succeed 
								in challenging work environment.</p>
								<br><h5>Objectives : </h5>
								<p>Basics of Hadoop along with it’s Ecosystem. HDFS and MapReduce. Hadoop cluster – setup, maintenance, 
								monitoring, troubleshooting and recovery from failure. Load balancing, High availability &amp; Federation.
								Hardware and network requirements and optimal configurations. Kerberos-based security for Hadoop cluster.
								Ecosystem - HBase, Pig, Flume, Hive, Impala, Sqoop and Oozie.</p>
								<br><h5>Lab Overview : </h5>
								<p>Each student set up a pseudo distributed single node cluster on their laptops. In addition, students 
								will be shown how to run a larger ~4 to 8 node cluster in Rackspace along with real life data projects. 
								The structure will consist of about 40% labs and 60% lecture. Hands-on exercises will be done throughout 
								the course.</p>
								<br><h5>Prerequisite &amp; Target Audience : </h5>
								<p>This course is designed for IT administrators and developers with some basic programming skills and 
								knowledge of Linux. Existing knowledge of Hadoop is not required.</p>
								<br><h5>Duration : </h5><p>4-5 Days OR 32-40 Hours</p>	
								<br><h5>Price : </h5>
